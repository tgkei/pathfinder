1. instead of nested for loop for drawing lines, just used one for loop
2. split one file to module 
3. Changed variable names that may confuse the data type
    eg1) open_set -> open_queue
    eg2) open_set_hash -> open_set
4. A* search algorithm can be improved [TODO] ***********************************
    - currently even if the better path is found in node in queue, it does not update
      - MARKED with TODO
    - cnt doesn't seem really affect algorithm (think it can be replaced by g_score)
5. change adding neighbors with simpler code [TODO] *****************************
6. More algorith(BFS, DFS, bottom-up with DP) 
7. variable started is removed since it never changes to True
8. algorithms are registered at the beginning and is called by Algorithm class which is abstract class of all the other algorithms
